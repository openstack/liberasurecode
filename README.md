liberasurecode
==============

liberasurecode is an Erasure Code API library written in C with pluggable Erasure Code backends.

----

Highlights
==========

 * Unified Erasure Coding interface for common storage workloads.

 * Pluggable Erasure Code backends - liberasurecode supports the following backends:

      - 'liberasurecode_rs_vand' - Native, software-only Erasure Coding implementation that supports a Reed-Solomon backend
      - 'Jerasure' - Erasure Coding library that supports Reed-Solomon, Cauchy backends [1]
      - 'ISA-L' - Intel Storage Acceleration Library - SIMD accelerated Erasure Coding backends [2]
      - 'SHSS' - NTT Lab Japan's hybrid Erasure Coding backend [4]
      - 'Flat XOR HD' - built-in to liberasurecode, based on [3]
      - 'libphazr' - Phazr.IO's erasure code backend with built-in privacy [5]
      - 'NULL' template backend implemented to help future backend writers


 * True 'plugin' architecture - liberasurecode uses Dynamically Loaded (DL)
   libraries to realize a true 'plugin' architecture.  This also allows one to
   build liberasurecode indepdendent of the Erasure Code backend libraries.

 * Cross-platform - liberasurecode is known to work on Linux (Fedora/Debian
   flavors), Solaris, BSD and Darwin/Mac OS X.

 * Community support - Developed alongside Erasure Code authority Kevin
   Greenan, liberasurecode is an actively maintained open-source project with
   growing community involvement (Openstack Swift, Ceph, PyECLib, NTT Labs).
